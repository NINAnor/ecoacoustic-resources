# ecoacoustic-resources

# Overview

This GitHub repository is dedicated to becoming a central hub for ecoacoustic resources across Europe. Our mission is to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tools, and networks among researchers, conservationists, and enthusiasts engaged in the field of eco-acoustics. [Ecoacoustics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12304-015-9248-x) is a rapidly evolving discipline that uses sound to monitor and understand the environment, particularly wildlife and ecosystems. By documenting and analyzing the sounds of nature, we can gain valuable insights into biodiversity, habitat health, and the effects of human activities on natural landscapes.

# Contents of the Repository

## Comprehensive Software List: 

A curated collection of software tools essential for ecoacoustic research. This includes applications for sound recording, analysis, data visualization, and AI-based species identification. Each tool is accompanied by a brief description, installation guide, and use-case examples.

## Dataset Directory: 

An extensive compilation of eco-acoustic datasets available in Europe. These datasets range from annotated sound libraries of European wildlife to long-term acoustic monitoring data from various ecosystems. We provide direct links to datasets and metadata descriptions.

## Community Contacts: 

A network directory featuring contact information for experts, researchers, and practitioners in the field of ecoacoustics across Europe. This section aims to foster collaboration, share expertise, and provide mentorship opportunities for those new to the field.

## Ongoing Projects

A compilation of the ongoing projects that include ecoacoustic data collection and analysis. 

## Available Models

This section showcases a range of AI models used for species classification or more holistic algorithms (e.g. ecosystem health assessment). Each model is presented with concise documentation, including its purpose, and its related paper. This evolving collection serves as a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in ecoacoustic studies, and we welcome contributions of new models and updates to existing ones.

## Contributing to the Repository

We warmly welcome contributions from the ecoacoustic community. Whether you have a new software tool to share, a dataset to add, or insights to offer, **your input is invaluable**. Please refer to our [contribution guidelines](#community-contribution-and-participation) for more information on how you can be a part of this growing repository.
