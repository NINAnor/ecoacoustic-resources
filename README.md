# ecoacoustic-resources

# Overview

This GitHub repository is dedicated to becoming a central hub for eco-acoustic resources across Europe. Our mission is to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tools, and networks among researchers, conservationists, and enthusiasts engaged in the field of eco-acoustics. Eco-acoustics is a rapidly evolving discipline that uses sound to monitor and understand the environment, particularly wildlife and ecosystems. By documenting and analyzing the sounds of nature, we can gain valuable insights into biodiversity, habitat health, and the effects of human activities on natural landscapes.

## Contents of the Repository

Comprehensive Software List: A curated collection of software tools essential for eco-acoustic research. This includes applications for sound recording, analysis, data visualization, and AI-based species identification. Each tool is accompanied by a brief description, installation guide, and use-case examples.

## Dataset Directory: 

An extensive compilation of eco-acoustic datasets available in Europe. These datasets range from annotated sound libraries of European wildlife to long-term acoustic monitoring data from various ecosystems. We provide direct links to datasets and metadata descriptions.

## Community Contacts: 

A network directory featuring contact information for experts, researchers, and practitioners in the field of eco-acoustics across Europe. This section aims to foster collaboration, share expertise, and provide mentorship opportunities for those new to the field.
