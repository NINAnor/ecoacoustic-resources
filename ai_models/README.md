# Available Models

This section showcases a range of acoustic and eco-acoustic models, from species classification algorithms to more holistic algorithms (e.g. ecosystem health assessment). This section contained two distinct tables: a list of general acoustic models that can be used as pre-trained models and models more related to eco-acoustic per se.
